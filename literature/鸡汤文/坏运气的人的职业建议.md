网上的大多数职业建议，都来自那些取得了巨大成就的人。所有这些建议都没有充分考虑运气的因素，实际上很多人运气不好，事业受到了很大影响。

现在，很多企业陷入了困境，我就在一家这样的科技公司工作了两年。回顾这两年，我总结了几点经验教训。如果你的职业生涯也遇到了坏运气，不妨可以参考一下。

1. 如果公司业绩不好没有前途，但是愿意给你提供一些优惠条件，让你留下来。你可以接受，但要立即开始寻找新工作，不要留恋那些优惠条件。
2. 公司不是你的家人。某些同事也许是你的朋友，但就像大学室友一样，毕业了也依然可以是朋友。不要因为人际关系的舒适而留下。
3. 不要以为公司情况不好，内部政治就会简单一些。情况恰恰相反，也许以前没有内部政治，但是一旦大家意识到，公司已经变成了一个零和游戏，某些人的得益就是另一些人的损失，就会出现内部政治。经济衰退时期，零和游戏的出现可能性更大。
4. 公司的应变举措，也许会奏效。也许不会。你必须决定是否值得等待，要知道你的时间就是沉没成本。一旦公司失败，你以前投入的时间是无法弥补的。

## Career advice for people with bad luck

Most career advice on the internet is from people who had some sort of meteoric success. Why read advice from someone who’s had a mediocre career? But there’s massive sampling bias. All this advice will try to draw grand, sweeping narratives and also typically fails to sufficiently factor in luck.

I worked at a struggling tech company for a couple years, and spent a lot of hours with my friends (also in similar situations and colleagues examining what we would’ve told our past selves. Below is a quick distillation of wisdom if:

### Your company is struggling

1. If you get a retention offer, take it and start looking immediately. DO NOT act like you’ve already earned the money. Those 6-12 months will destroy your soul. At one point, I was calculating how much extra I was making, per remaining hour, to keep myself in meetings. “They’re paying you $200 to be here, just shut the fuck up and nod…”

2. The company is not your family. Some of the people in the company are your friends in the current context. It’s like your dorm in college. Hopefully some of them will still be your friends after. But don’t stay because you’re comfortable.

3. Don’t think that there won’t be politics because there wasn’t politics before. Politics emerge when the players believe the game is zero sum. In a recession, the players are more likely to believe the game is zero sum.

4. Maybe the turnaround will work. Maybe it won’t. You have to decide whether it’s worth waiting for. Your existing time is sunk costs.

### You’re not sure of how much risk you want to take

1. It’s okay to go for the safe job. Sure, Airbnb was founded during a recession. 50% of the time, you’ll survive the charge across no-man’s-land and reach the enemy trench.

2. It’s also okay to take risks. Staying at a company that’s slowly dying has its costs too. Stick around too long and you’ll lose your belief that you can build, that change is possible. Try not to learn the wrong habits.

3. Just… try not to fuck up the ratio. You can take the risk but if you do so, demand some of the upside.

### You’re finding a new job

“When a management team with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact. - Warren Buffett, maybe

1. When picking a job, yes, your manager matters. But if you have an amazing manager at a shit company you’ll still have a shit time. In some ways, it’ll actually be worse. If they’re good at their job (including retaining you), they’ll keep you at a bad company for too long. And then they’ll leave, because they’re smart and competent. Maybe they’ll take you with them.

2. Your equity package is a lottery ticket with expected value of zero.

3. VCs are salespeople for a living, are constantly talking their own book, and only have to be right 1/10 of the time. Even the ones you trust to have your best interests at heart are often wrong. Don’t ever join a company solely on the recommendation of a VC. Even if they’re a board member. It’s the nature of boards that they ignore (externally) problems until their hand is forced.

4. “Take any role, at any pay, on a rocketship and everything will work out” is only sort of true. It’s the Hollywood model… do it for the exposure and it might be great! Technically true, but it’s also a way for people with more information to offload the risk of bad companies onto… you.

5. Seriously, you have to form your own opinion. Hyped = hiring good PR != successful. Every time I’ve outsourced my thinking for a job change (n=2), I’ve missed out on 5-6 figures of equity appreciation. But, who the fuck knows.

Lastly, it all tends to work out, on average, eventually.
